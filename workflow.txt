Quick details / what to do inside each step: 

	1.	Define question & success criteria
	    ‚Ä¢	Exact claim: e.g., ‚ÄúWe compare Grad-CAM vs SHAP for CNN and ViT on BreakHis/Camelyon16 and quantify fidelity and clinician trust.‚Äù
	    ‚Ä¢	Concrete success metrics: target IoU improvement, statistical significance, SUS score threshold, paper contributions.
	2.	Collect datasets & annotations
	    ‚Ä¢	Public: BreakHis, BACH, Camelyon16 (use Camelyon ROI masks for validation).
	    ‚Ä¢	Create consistent train/val/test splits; optionally hold out one dataset (cross-site test).
	3.	Preprocess & create patches + masks
	    ‚Ä¢	Stain normalization (e.g., Macenko), tile WSI into patches (e.g., 224√ó224), filter background, save patch ‚Üê‚Üí mask mapping.
	    ‚Ä¢	Save metadata CSV with image id, coordinates, label, mask path.
	4.	Choose & prepare models (CNN + ViT)
	    ‚Ä¢	CNN: ResNet50 or DenseNet (transfer learning).
	    ‚Ä¢	ViT: small ViT or Swin-T (pretrained).
	    ‚Ä¢	Use PyTorch with MPS backend (Mac M1) or TF-metal. Implement same dataloader for both.
	5.	Train / fine-tune
	    ‚Ä¢	Fine-tune last layers, then unfreeze as needed. Monitor accuracy, ROC/AUC, and save best checkpoints.
	6.	Produce XAI outputs
	    ‚Ä¢	Grad-CAM for CNNs (and transformer-adapted Grad-CAM or attention rollout for ViT).
	    ‚Ä¢	SHAP: use GradientSHAP/DeepSHAP or KernelSHAP on representative patches (KernelSHAP is expensive ‚Äî sample or apply to fewer instances).
	    ‚Ä¢	Save heatmaps (aligned to original image coordinates).
	7.	Quantitative XAI evaluation
	    ‚Ä¢	Compute IoU / Dice vs ROI masks, deletion/insertion AUC for faithfulness, pointing-game score, and pixel-wise correlation between Grad-CAM & SHAP.
	    ‚Ä¢	Run statistical tests (paired Wilcoxon or t-test) comparing methods/models.
	8.	Simulated multi-expert validation
	    ‚Ä¢	If multiple annotations exist, form consensus masks (majority). If not, simulate annotator variance (morphological jitter or synthetic masks) and measure robustness.
	    ‚Ä¢	Report inter-rater agreement (Œ∫) and XAI alignment with consensus.
	9.	Build interactive HCI UI
	    ‚Ä¢	Minimal required features: show raw image, toggle Grad-CAM/SHAP, side-by-side view, opacity slider, zoom/pan, per-image metrics panel, export (PNG, PDF) and note annotation.
	    ‚Ä¢	Tech choices: Tkinter (desktop) or Streamlit / Flask (web). Provide ‚Äúload image / choose model / choose XAI‚Äù flows.
	10.	Usability test
	    ‚Ä¢	Recruit 3‚Äì10 users (peers or ideally a pathologist). Tasks: interpret map, decide if model is trustworthy, rate SUS and qualitative feedback.
	    ‚Ä¢	Collect time-to-decision, trust ratings, and freeform comments.

	11.	Analyze & identify failure modes
	    ‚Ä¢	Correlate poor metrics with visual failures; inspect low IoU cases. Decide whether changes are needed (data balance, augmentations, patch size).

	12.	Iterate
	    ‚Ä¢	Options: tune thresholds, ensemble maps, produce uncertainty maps (MC dropout), limit SHAP to important patches, or add composite explanation. Repeat training/XAI as needed.

	13.	Finalize artifacts
	    ‚Ä¢	Organize code repo, final models, dataset split lists, scripts to reproduce metrics, UI package, and all figure assets.

	14.	Write the paper
	    ‚Ä¢	Sections: intro (gap), methods (datasets, preprocessing, models, explainability), experiments (quantitative + HCI), results, discussion & limitations, conclusion. Include reproducibility appendix and ablation studies.

	15.	Reproducibility & submission prep
	    ‚Ä¢	Add environment file, quickstart guide (how to run on Mac M1), license, and optional Docker/conda. Prepare cover letter and submission checklist for target journals.


Useful practical tips: 

	‚Ä¢	Save intermediate outputs (patches, heatmaps, metrics CSV) ‚Äî they speed iteration.
	‚Ä¢	Limit SHAP runs to a validation subset to save compute; report representative examples.
	‚Ä¢	Use pretrained weights to save time; train for fewer epochs with careful LR scheduling.
	‚Ä¢	Automate experiments with a small config system (YAML) so results are reproducible.
	‚Ä¢	For HCI, start with a simple Streamlit prototype ‚Äî quick to build and share ‚Äî then refine to Tkinter if you need a desktop app.
