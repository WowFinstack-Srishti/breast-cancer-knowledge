CNN:
-> basic image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a key skill in machine learning,
     especially for projects involving visual data like medical imaging, object recognition, etc.


üß† (1) What is Image Classification?

Image classification is a task where a model takes an input image and assigns it a label (category).
Examples:
	‚Ä¢	Is this a cat or dog?
	‚Ä¢	Is this X-ray normal or pneumonia?


üß± (2) Why CNN for Images?

CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) are designed to process pixel data. Unlike regular neural networks, CNNs use filters to detect features (edges, corners, patterns) in images.


‚öôÔ∏è (3) CNN Building Blocks

    üß© 1. Convolutional Layer
	    ‚Ä¢	Applies a filter (kernel) over the image to detect features.
	    ‚Ä¢	Think: edge detectors, texture detectors.

    üß© 2. Activation Function (ReLU)
	    ‚Ä¢	Introduces non-linearity to allow complex patterns.

    üß© 3. Pooling Layer (MaxPooling)
	    ‚Ä¢	Reduces the size (downsampling), retains key features.
	    ‚Ä¢	Helps reduce computation & overfitting.

    üß© 4. Flatten Layer
	    ‚Ä¢	Converts the 2D output into 1D vector to feed into dense layers.

    üß© 5. Fully Connected (Dense) Layer
	    ‚Ä¢	Final classification decision is made here.
	    ‚Ä¢	Often ends in a Softmax (for multiclass) or Sigmoid (for binary) layer.
